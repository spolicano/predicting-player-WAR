# Predicting Player WAR

Building a model to predict the wins above replacement (WAR) for a player's next season.  
The data will be downloaded from pybaseball and cleaned.
Feature selection will be done using a sequential feature selector to identify the most promising predictors for machine learning.
A ridge regression model will be trained to predict future season WAR, measuring error and improving the model.
